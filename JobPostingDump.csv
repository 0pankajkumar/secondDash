Flock is an enterprise messaging and collaboration app. At Flock we believe that synchronous messaging tools, supported with internal and external applications, have the power to smash organisational hierarchies, breakdown silos in the workplace, help companies better capture innovative ideas, support individuals in making faster decisions, and also bring a more personable communication style into the workplace.

With 30,000 businesses already using the platform we know that we are onto something big, and are now gearing up for a period of rapid growth. 

Flock is founded by Bhavin Turakhia. Serial entrepreneur and billionaire, Bhavin Turakhia is driven by a passion for problem-solving and maximizing efficiency through technology driven innovations. In the last 22 years, he has built 5 successful businesses, all driven by his belief that “it is our moral obligation to make an impact that is proportionate to our potential”. At 17, he co-founded Resellerclub, Logicboxes and BigRock, which he exited in a $160mn transaction in 2014. He is presently heading Flock - a suite of productivity apps, Zeta - a digital payments platform, and Radix - a leading registry for top-level extensions.

What is the Job like?
This is an exciting early stage sales role (although we have over 100,000 users and we’re growing fast, we only started our monetization journey less than a year ago!). Starting as an individual contributor hitting a quota role, the view is that the successful candidate will help us build and lead our a rapidly growing inside sales team within the calendar year. 
To start with, in addition to carrying an individual quota, you will be helping to design the systems and processes required for you to scale the mid-market team.  You will have lots of support with an Ops and Marketing team already in place; but at the same time you will have the space to make real mark on the shape of the organisation.
